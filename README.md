# tech-blog

## Description
This is a Model-veiw-controller style tech blog that was built with full stack technology. The blogger is able to see all of the posts from other bloggers and themselves on the homepage, they can log-in and view their dashboard, so they are able to create a post. The blogger can also comment on the posts of others. The application is deployed by Heroku. 

## Technology Used:
- MVC paradigm
- Modularized code 
- Dynamic HTML using Handlebars.js, express-handlebars
- User authentication, bcrypt package and connect-session-sequelize
- dontenv package
- MySQL database, MYSQL2
- Sequelize
- Heroku
- Application cookies with express-session

## Challenge notes:
I was unable to deploy the application to Heroku successfully. The application runs locally but without the posts.
